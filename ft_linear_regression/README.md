this project has been developed in python3.7, maybe it's runnable in 3.6 or less. I don't know, sorry :)

Instalation
'''
You need python
python3 -mpip install matplotlib
'''

Run the project:

1) try linear function with an untrained gradiant descent algorithm.
python3.6 linearFunction.py

2) run the visual to look at raw datas.
python3.6 visualisation.py

3) run gradient descent, to generate the optimal coefficients for linear aproximation.
The animation on display represent an evolution of the linear regression to reduce the difference between our theorical model and empiric datas.
python3.6 gradientDescent.py

4) -optional- run again the visual to watch the final result.
python3.6 visualisation.py

5) Run the linear function in order to test the result our descent algorithm
python3.6 linearFunction.py
